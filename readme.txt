== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I get a 404 error when viewing a project page =
Because I changed the way slugs are configured it can happen that you get a 404 error, try updating the slug via Settings > Permalinks.

= How can I add my portfolio to a page? =
This plugin provides you with many configurations for shortcodes, while we're still working on an easier/better way you can check out all configurations at Settings > Portfolio.

= Can I show the project category in the slug? =
Unfortunately no, I'm still working on this (I'm a huge fan of pretty permalinks so I want this just as bad as you do) splease be patient :)
